## Discussion Questions

- Q: Who is Roy Fielding?

  - A: Roy Thomas Fielding (born 1965) is an American computer scientist, one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification, and the originator of the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style.

- Q: Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

  - A: They were programmed to talk to every machine initially, but over time, that standard fell away.

- Q: What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

  - A: HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web, and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser.

- Q: What does a `GET` do?

  - A: The HTTP GET method is used to **read** (or retrieve) a representation of a resource.

- Q:
  What does a `POST` do?

  - A: The POST verb is most-often utilized to **create** new resources.
