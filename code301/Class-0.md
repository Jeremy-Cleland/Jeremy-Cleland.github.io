## Discussion Questions

- Q: What is a “component”?

  - A: A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface. [^1]

  - A:  
    - Reusability − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different
  applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

    - Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

    - Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

    - Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

    - Encapsulated − A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.
    - Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

- Q: What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?

  - A: Ease of deployment, Reduced cost, Ease of development, Reusable, Modification of technical complexity, Reliability and Independent.
