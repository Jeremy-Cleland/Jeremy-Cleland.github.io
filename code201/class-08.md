### Learn CSS- Flexbox

- Q: Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

  - A: Flexbox can be wrapped into multiple lines, but it's impossible to get the second row to line up with the first row. 


- Q: Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

  - A: The main axis is set by `flex-direction` property and can be a row or column. The cross axis runs in the other direction to the main axis, so if `flex `direction` is a row the cross axis is a column.

- Q: How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

  - A: Reversing the flow of items of how they are ordered in the HTML document.

### CSS Layout- Flexbox

- Q: What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?

  - A:
    - Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.
  
    - Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available.
  
    - Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content

- Q: How does this topic connect with your long term goals?
  
  - A: I like the front end; the user experience is essential for a successful website/program. Flexbox is very imporant to understand because CSS can disconnect the visual display and the DOM.
