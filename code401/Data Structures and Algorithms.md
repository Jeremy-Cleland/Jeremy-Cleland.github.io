## Discussion Questions

- Q: What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

  - A: The Big-O

- Q: How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

  - A: Most importantly no single data structure provides the best answer to all problems. Keeping this in mind, selecting the ideal data structure to address a certain issue requires that we consider the operations we will conduct as well as their frequency. The next step is to decide which data structure offers the optimum performance trade-off for the tasks at hand.
