It's all too often that one can believe that their abilities, characteristics, and talents are fixed when you have a fixed mindset. Since what you already know is constant, you are unable to acquire any new knowledge. Although this initially seems harsh, you can overhear it come up in conversations with students in development courses, when people say things like "I'm bad at CSS," or "I can't do CSS." These are all illustrations of stuck mindsets.

Having a growth mindset is critical to be a software developer because of the constant growth and development of software languages. If one can only believe they can only be so good, then that would leave them not adapting with the rest of the community. Having a growth mindset allows for setbacks to be a point of motivation.
