- Q: What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

  - A: The skills I have learned while serving as a Special Forces Medic I have extensive experience working with diverse populations and building relationships. The key skill that I bring to the table, it’s leadership and management skills through detailed planning and strategy skills.

- Q: What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

  - A:

    - Step 1. Take a step back from the editor and re-read the question, and course content.

    - Step 2. Break the problem down to the smallest steps I feel is necessary. Translate those steps into pseudo-code.

    - Step 3.  Following that, write the code and jump into resources as needed. Typically if a problem is hard I will spend just as much time working on the problem as I'm writing notes.
